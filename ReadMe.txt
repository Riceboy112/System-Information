Name: main.cpp
	Main holds all of my functions I used to get the system information. I have got the information about my system, the hardware, system uptime, user mode and system mode, and memory information as well as converting seconds to minutes days, etcâ€¦

*******************************************************
*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************
   
   The program was developed and tested on gnu g++ 4.4.2.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on gcc ouray.cudenver.edu.

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [KongLab1.zip]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        makefile
        KongReadMe.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [KongLab1] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./[main]

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean

5. Run the program again 
   %./main
